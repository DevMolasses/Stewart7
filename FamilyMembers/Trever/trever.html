        <h1> Hobbies </h1>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have taken an interest in many different hobbies.  It would be truthful to say that I want to try everything though I only stick with a few.  Currently, I am interested in the following hobbies:
            <!-- <ul>
                <li><details><summary>Electronics/Programming</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arduino - project design, development, and programming.</li>
                        <li>Raspberry Pi - Mostly copying others work at this point.</li>
                        <li>C# - Writing small application that make my life simpler at work.  Currently learning to use Xamairin to write cross-platform mobile apps.</li>
                        <li>HTML5 - I am learning HTML5 in order to make my own websites.</li>
                    </ul>
                </details></li>
                <li><details><summary>RC Trucks</summary>
                    I enjoy to drive my RC trucks.  I currently own two monster trucks (one nitro and one electric), a stadium truck, and a small rock crawler.  Unfortunately, since I have moved to Texas I haven't been able to find that magical spot that makes driving exciting.  Most of the areas that I have found are pretty much a grassy field with little to no obstacles.  Hopefully I will find a cool spot soon to get out and drive more.
